# Frequently Asked Questions

## A page looks wrong or stays empty. What can I do?

Look at the diagnostics first, as many issues come from a script that failed, or a resource not being loaded:

```cs
foreach (var message in engine.Diagnostics.Messages)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"[{message.Kind}] {message.Text}");
}
```

Layout and painting are done by AngleSharp.Renderer, styles by AngleSharp.Css, and scripts by AngleSharp.Js. Sites relying on the page being rendered by a client-side framework are the most likely to stay empty, as a single unsupported API may stop their script. Please open an issue in the respective repository with a small reproduction.

## How do I wait until a page is ready?

The task returned by `NavigateAsync` completes once the document has been loaded. Scripts may keep on changing the page afterwards. There is no general answer for when such a page is finished, so wait for what you are looking for:

```cs
await engine.NavigateAsync("https://example.org");

while (await engine.InvokeAsync(document => document?.QuerySelector("p")) is null)
{
    await Task.Delay(100);
}
```

## Why does my code throw or behave strangely when using the document?

AngleSharp is not thread-safe, so the DOM must only be used on the event loop. Use `InvokeAsync`. Do not keep elements around to use them outside of it. See [Threading](../general/02-Engine.md#threading).

## Why does waiting for the engine hang in my code?

The event loop is waiting for itself if an operation of the engine is awaited with blocking inside of `InvokeAsync` or a DOM event handler. Start the operation outside, instead.

Prefer `await` over `Wait()` and `Result` in general. This includes tests: assertions that block while running async code (e.g., `Assert.ThrowsAsync` of NUnit) may hang, so use an awaited `try` / `catch` instead.

## Why do `ScrollPosition` and `ScrollTop` differ?

Scrolling is smooth and runs ahead of the DOM. See [Overscan and Scrolling](../general/03-Rendering.md#overscan-and-scrolling).

## How do I persist logins?

Use a `ProfileDirectory`. Without one, cookies and storage are gone with the engine:

```cs
using var persistent = new BrowserEngine(new BrowserOptions { ProfileDirectory = "profile" });
```

## Why does a `data:` address show an empty page?

Characters like `<` need to be percent-encoded in the address. Use `Uri.EscapeDataString`, or `LoadHtmlAsync` to show markup:

```cs
await engine.NavigateAsync("data:text/html," + Uri.EscapeDataString("<title>Hello</title>"));
```

## Does the engine run on servers without a display?

Yes. Painting only requires SkiaSharp, whose native assets are included. On Linux they depend on fontconfig, so make sure it and some fonts are installed. Only `AngleSharp.Browser.Avalonia` needs a UI.
